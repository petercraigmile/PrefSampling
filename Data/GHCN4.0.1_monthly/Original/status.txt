GHCN-Monthly, Version 4, Status File 

(users can use this file to determine overall current status, including 
information related to previous changes and errata).

DISCLAIMER: The status file does not record every possible change that may
have occurred from one version to another.  This would be impractical for a
variety of reasons. Therefore if a user is interested in discovering every 
possible difference between two different file versions, they will need to 
construct their own program to determine all possible changes between the file
versions.

The source known as 'mcdw-unpublished' has changed its source flag from (D) to
(&) this is to reflect the D flag in GHCN-Daily, which uses CF6 data from the
High Plains Regional Climate Center (HPRCC). The ghcnm-flags.txt file has been
updated to reflect this change.

With the early online release of the GHCN-M v4 paper, this product is being 
transitioned from a public beta (v4.b.2) to operations (v4.0.0). During this
transition, issues may arise with data output. For questions, please email
ncdc.ghcnm@noaa.gov 

********************************************************************************

02/16/2018

Beginning with the 20180215 run, a third version of v4 beta will be produced.
In addition to QCU and QCF, a QFE inventory and data file will be generated.
The QFE includes estimated data for stations for the period of 1961-1990. Data
are estimated based upon neighboring station info in the Pairwise Homogeneity
Algorithm (PHA). Data is only provided between 1961 and 1990, and will be used
to assess climate trends.

Beginning this week, v4 beta will begin ingesting new data and adjusting it 
through the Pairwise Homogeneity Algorithm. This update essentially reverts the
change that was made on March 20th, 2017.

********************************************************************************

03/20/2017

Starting with the 20170310 run, v4 Beta will stop adjusting new data ingested. 
Instead, quality controlled unadjusted (QCU) data will be appended
to both QCU and QCF files of v4 beta. During the first month of the new year,
the Pairwise Homogenity Adjustment (PHA) will be run again to adjust the datasets
entire period of record.
